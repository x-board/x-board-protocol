x-board-protocol
================

This repository is for the design of the x-board protocol.

The protocol should be implemented by the host images as well as by the client,
creating the bridge between the two. It also provides a reference for 
implementation in other hosts as well as alternative clients.

The protocol definition can be found in the [docs directory](docs). This for
support of GitHub Pages; the contents of this folder is the actual protocol
definition rather than some sort of documentation. Likewise, the main page
is called readme because that works nicely with the GitHub interface and with
GitHub pages.
